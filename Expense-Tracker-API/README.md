# Expense Tracker API Project
The Expense Tracker API is a backend application designed to help users manage their expenses efficiently. It provides functionalities for user registration, authentication, and CRUD operations on expenses. JWT for secure user authentication, and MySQL for persistent data storage. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in building secure RESTful APIs and integrating strong authentication mechanisms.

# Features
## User Authentication with JWT: 
### Secure Login and Registration:
- The API supports user registration and login functionalities, using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and session management. JWT ensures that user sessions are secure.
### Token-Based Access: 
- Endpoints are protected using JWT, ensuring that only authenticated users can access or modify their expenses.
## Expense Management:
- Users can Add, Update, Delete and Update their expense.
### List and Filter Expenses:
- The API allows users to list their expenses and apply custom date filters.
### Spring Boot:
- The app is created using Spring Boot, which uses RESTful web service.
### MySQL Database:
- The application uses MySQL to persist user and expense data.
# What I Learned
- Implemented secure user authentication using JWT, gaining a deep understanding of token-based security mechanisms
- Acquired skills in designing relational database models and managing persistent data using Spring Data JPA.
