# Real-Time Voting Application
This project is a real-time voting application built using Spring Boot for the backend, WebSocket technologies for real-time communication, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It allows users to participate in polls by submitting their votes multiple times and provides immediate updates on voting results to all connected clients. The application dynamically displays the results as votes are cast, allowing users to see the current standings in real-time.

## Features
- Real-Time Voting: Users can cast their votes using a WebSocket connection. Votes are immediately processed and broadcast to all clients, updating the voting results in real-time.

- Real-Time Results: The application updates and displays voting results dynamically as votes are cast. All connected clients see the latest results instantly, reflecting the votes received so far.

## What I Learned
- WebSocket Integration: Implemented real-time communication using WebSocket and the STOMP protocol with Spring Boot, allowing for immediate updates across all connected clients.
